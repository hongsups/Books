# Books

This is a repository where I keep summaries, examples, exercises and practies from books related to machine learning and data sciene in general.

I started reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. I have been creating a Jupyter notebook per chapter (from Chapter 2). Following the example code snippets is quite useful because it seems that the author is trying to use a range of different methods or libraries to do the same things. It's also a great opportunity to refresh my memory on numpy and find interesting features of the library.
