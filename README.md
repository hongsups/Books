# Books

This is a repository where I keep summaries, examples, exercises and practies from books related to machine learning and data sciene in general.

I started reading Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka. I have been creating a Jupyter notebook per chapter (from Chapter 2). Following the example code snippets is quite useful because it seems that the author is trying to use a range of different methods or libraries to do the same things. It's also a great opportunity to refresh my memory on numpy and find interesting features of the library.

Although it has a great amount of information with a nice structure, sometimes I get the impression that this won't be enough as a textbook level for machine learning. It does introduce some ideas about how an algorithm works (with some math) but for a better understanding, having a more thorough ML textbook would be helpful, like [this one](http://www.springer.com/978-0-387-31073-2). Plus, certain parts do not have much depth compared to others and for those, it would've been nice to have some information for further reading. However in general (up to Ch4 so far), fun and great material.
